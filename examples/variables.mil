# Mil provides registers for storing/loading values
# each of the registers are named after a character
# Unlike dc, registers can only store numbers
# Mil uses `s` for storing and `l` for loading registers
50 sa # We store 50 to register `a`
40 sb # and store 40 to register `b`
la lb # We load both of `a` and `b` to stack
d d # Then duplicate register `b` twice
+ + + # Then sum all of them together, and print
