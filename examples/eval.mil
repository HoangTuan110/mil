# Mil also supports strings to store functions
# and for executing them, Mil uses `x` like `dc`

# For storing functions, Mil uses `F`, followed
# by a character.
# Because Mil uses 2 seperate arrays for storing
# general registers and function registers, this
# means that you can have the Q general register
# and the `Q` function register

# This example demonstrates how you can execute
# and store functions

# Executing a string
"4d*v"x
